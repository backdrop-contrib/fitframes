DESCRIPTION
-----------

FitVids is a jQuery plugin for fluid width video embeds.

It's useful if you are using a responsive theme (such as Omega), and want the videos to scale.

INSTALLATION
------------

Just enable the module. You do not need to configure anything.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

The module assumes that the videos to be resized are in an element with class="region".
There isn't any UI yet - the next release will add an options page to allow you to specify your own jQuery selectors.
