# fitFrames

## Description

This module implements a small Javascript to make iframes responsive, while
trying to maintain the aspect-ratio of the iframe container. This can be useful
for embedded videos, PDFs, and other iframed content.

## Configuration

### Custom domains

Leave blank to apply fitFrames to all iframe elements, or add one or more custom
domains to apply only to certain domains, such as `youtube.com` or
`docs.google.com`.
